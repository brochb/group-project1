As a user, I want the books that I find to display on the page in a box format, with a clickable Title.
As a user, I want to be able to see my bookview history.

As a user, I want the ability to save my favorite books to come back to later.
(hover over the section where the book title and short summary are added, and a save button appears, clicking it
will add it to the  'inventory')
