Added some much needed text for the README

As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes across the web, and be able to sort them
by region of origin, as well as ingredients used.

As a user, I want the recipes that I find to display on the page in a box format, with a clickable image of the cuisine.
As a user, I want the recipes that I find to navigate me to their page of origin if I click on them.

As a user, I want the ability to save my favorite recipes to come back to later.


It is finished when the user can select from a drop down menu or autocomplete textbox, the region of origin for the recipe search, and by popular ingredients in either a drop down menu, or a autocomplete textbox.

It is finished when the 12 MOST POPULAR results are represented by an image, and the images are aranged in a 3x4 grid.

It is finished when the user can store a recipe for later use.
